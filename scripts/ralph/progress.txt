## Codebase Patterns
- Python 3.11 is available at /usr/bin/python3 but pip/ruff are NOT installed — only syntax validation (ast.parse) is possible for linting in this environment
- All app code lives in /workspace/app/ as a Python package
- Config is centralized in app/config.py using os.getenv with defaults
- Ruff is listed in requirements.txt for use inside Docker containers, not the host
- git config must be set before first commit: user.email + user.name
- mlflow/data and mlflow/artifacts use .gitkeep files to track empty directories

## 2026-02-26 - US-001
- What was implemented: Full project scaffold including docker-compose.yml (4 services: api, chromadb, ollama, mlflow), Dockerfile, requirements.txt, README.md, and complete FastAPI app skeleton (app/)
- Files changed: Dockerfile, README.md, docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt, app/__init__.py, app/config.py, app/evaluate.py, app/health.py, app/ingest.py, app/main.py, app/models.py, app/prompts.py, app/query.py, mlflow/data/.gitkeep, mlflow/artifacts/.gitkeep
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All US-002 through US-006 code was written as part of US-001 scaffold — future stories just need verification/tweaks, not full rewrites
  - The lifespan handler in main.py handles Ollama model pulling via POST /api/pull streaming
  - ChromaDB HTTP client uses host=CHROMA_HOST, port=CHROMA_PORT (not URL string)
  - ruff is not available on the host — use python3 -c "import ast..." for basic syntax checking
  - docker-compose.yml uses chromadb/chroma:0.5.15 image which exposes port 8000 internally, mapped to 8001 on host
